# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Prediction

This repository contains a **machine learning project** to predict laptop prices based on their specifications, along with a deployed **Streamlit application** for interactive usage.

## 1. Project Overview

With the increasing variety of laptop configurations in the market, predicting the price of a laptop based on its specifications is valuable for buyers, sellers, and market analysts. This project:

- Performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a comprehensive laptop dataset.
- Builds and evaluates a **Random Forest Regressor** model to predict laptop prices.
- Applies **log transformation** to handle right-skewed price distribution.
- Uses a **feature engineering pipeline** with scaling and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Deploys the trained model via **Streamlit** for real-time price prediction.

## 4. Model Performance

- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **RÂ² Score:** ~ 0.8655
- **RMSE:** ~ 0.22

The model performs well with a balanced trade-off between bias and variance, achieving high accuracy on unseen data.
